# Projectlost
My motavation and reason for this project was to make this site more accessible for users.

The problem that was solved during this project was the site is now easier for the user to navigate the site.

I learned how to properly notate in HTML and CSS. I also had a huge learning experience with creating a repository and using GitHub for this project.
