# Projectlost
Description:

My motavation and reason for this project was to make this site more accessible for users and to practice my knowledge on HTML and CSS by revising this code.

The problem that was solved during this project was the site is now easier for the user to navigate the site.

I learned how to properly notate in HTML and CSS as well as the importance of discribing the images you add onto your site using ALT. This project really helped me understand HTML elements and how simplify then to make the code easier to read. I also had a huge learning experience with creating a repository and using GitHub for this project.

I cloned the starter code for this project from the repository, https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram. All of the images, HTML, and CSS were cloned except for the website screenshot.
